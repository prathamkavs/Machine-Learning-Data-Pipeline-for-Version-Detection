Steps and Tools:

**Web Scraping:** Used BeautifulSoup to scrape content from 3,200 websites, focusing on retrieving sections of text where version numbers were likely to be found.

**Text Tokenization:** Utilized NLTK for tokenizing the scraped text into meaningful tokens.

**Feature Representation:** Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert the textual data into feature vectors.

**Model Selection:** Chose Logistic Regression for its simplicity and efficiency in binary classification tasks.

**Training and Evaluation:** Trained the Logistic Regression model on a labeled dataset of text snippets with and without version numbers. Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Impact:** The pipeline automated the extraction and detection of version numbers, significantly reducing the manual effort involved in tracking software updates across numerous websites.
